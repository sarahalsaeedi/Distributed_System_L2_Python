Discuss the solution cost of your LE?

The solution cost of our Election process using Ring Alogrithm, in the worst cases cenario O(n^2) 
where n is the number of servers or node in the network
Total number of messages is = O(n^2)
message complexity :  O(n^2)

Discuss whether your LE fulfills the properties of a correct LE algo? 
In Our Case cenario with Ring Leader Election Alog the following done when we start running the topology:
1. Server1 builds an “Election” message (E), and sends it to its
next successor node. It inserts its ID which is randomly generated into the Election message
2. When process Pj receives the message, it appends its
ID and forwards the message
i. If the next node has crashed, Pj finds the next
alive node
3. When the message gets back to the process that
started the election:
i. it elects process with highest ID as coordinator,
and
ii. changes the message type to “Coordination”
message (C) and circulates it in the ring

Discuss the cost of adding messages to the board?

In this stage I guess the number of messages will be not increase and the cost of posting message to 
the board will be through the leader server which will handle wor propegate the message to all the servers in the 
network.

As well if there is post request done in a slave server it will direct that request to the leader server to handle the 
request as centeralized solution.

Briefly discuss pros&cons of centralized solutions?

pros:
1- less complex
2- easy to maintain
3- Sending least number of messages because it's throught the leader.
